      >prisons</a
    >
    are such a useful way to understand how we might think about what gets us
    closer to dismantling the system vs. what entrenches it further.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been thinking about public use of data (<a href="publicuseofdata.html"
      >more on that here</a
    >) and how it fits into this kind of framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worry that data encourages marginal thinking and constrains solutions.
    Showing that
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/"
      >Black people are overrepresented in jails and prisons by 5 times</a
    >
    suggests that there is a correct number of Black people to be kept in cages
    by the state, and that our goal should be racial parity in the prison
    population through a series of marginal reforms aimed at the
    overrepresentation but not the structural violence of the prisons, police,
    and jails.
  </p>
  <p>Can data be used in service of abolition?</p>
  <p>
    I've been thinking about this in the context of organizing to defund the DC
    Metropolitan Police Department.
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/charlottemcclintock/StopsByMPD"
      >A quick analysis</a
    >
    of recently released data shows that 75% of all people and 87% of the
    children stopped by MPD in the first half of 2020 were Black. 80% of white
    people who were stopped got some sort of ticket, compared to less than half
    of Black people, which pretty clearly shows the cops are stopping and
    harassing Black people (and children) without any cause to actually ticket
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Are these stats something that should be central in the discourse around
    defunding MPD? Or does putting them there legitimize this abstract,
    aggregated form of information which depersonalizes the harm and suggests
    marginal solutions? How can we talk about these numbers in a way that makes
    it clear that only structural changes will suffice for the injustice that is
    evident?
