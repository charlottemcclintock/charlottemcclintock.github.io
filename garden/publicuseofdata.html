  <h2>fearmongering about violent crime</h2>
  <h1>public (mis)use of data</h1>

  <br />
  <p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the utility of data in fighting for
    the abolition of the prison industrial complex. We live in a world where
    quantitative data is valued over so many other ways of knowing, but
    quantitative data is so limited in its descriptive capacity and so prone to
    misuse.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my <a href="../projects/decarcerate.html">recent work for the ACLU</a>, I
    saw the danger of incomplete description of the data. The Colorado
    Department of Public Safety released a press release on the 2020 crime data
    which stated that violent crime increased by 6.5%, emphasizing increases in
    murder and aggravated assault. Local news outlets immediately ran with the
    story of big increases in violent crime (The
    <a
      href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/11/colorado-crime-homicides-2020/"
    >
      Denver Post article</a
    >
    also importantly noted the likely influence of these numbers on criminal
    legal reform measures in the upcoming legislative session).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Colorado Department of Public Safety report relied on the FBI Uniform
    Crime Reporting definition of “violent crime” which includes murder,
    aggravated assault, non-consensual sex offense, and robbery, but importantly
    does not include simple assault (though many other federal definitions do).
    This omission is important because the overwhelming majority of violent
    crimes are simple assaults, which declined from 2019 to 2020. When simple
    assaults are included, the data shows that overall violent crime did not
    increase and in fact
    <em>decreased</em> by 0.3% from 2019 to 2020. The increase in aggravated
    assaults is largely balanced out by the decrease in simple assaults (as
    <a

      href="https://github.com/charlottemcclintock/COCrimeData/blob/main/plots/change-violent-detail.png"
      >this figure</a
    >
    shows), along with declines in non-consensual sex offenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ACLU is running a jail decarceration bill this session and the crime
    trends will factor heavily in a discussion on the impact of COVID-related
    jail decarceration on crime will be a major point of discussion in rallying
    support (this figure shows
    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/charlottemcclintock/COCrimeData/blob/main/plots/change-comp-annotated.png"
    >
      there was no association between jail decarceration and crime rate</a
    >).
  </p>

  <p>
    Omitting simple assault and only having public discourse about the types of
    assault which increased is potentially damaging to the probability of
    passing the decarceration legislation. Local media uncritically ran with the
    Colorado Department of Public Safety's incomplete and misleading
    characterization of trends in the data. We need more data capacity in the
    public interest to interrogate state narratives of data trends (especially
    in criminal legal data).
