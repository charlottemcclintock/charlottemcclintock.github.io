  <h1>How To Do Nothing</h1>

  <p>
    I loved this book. The author describes the book near the beginning as more
    of a walk with a friend than a lecture, and it reads that way. The highest
    praise I can give a book is the it has somehow changed how I move through
    the world, and this book pretty immediately changed my attention economy
    habits and my attention to bioregional place. Odell writes, “To do nothing
    is to hold yourself still so you can perceive what is there.”
  </p>
  <p>
    It sounds trivial and obvious, but I’ve realized that life is composed of
    days - yeah, there are the big milestones, but most of what composes our
    conscious lives is the in between - the lazy afternoons and busy mornings.
    Odell describes how the attention economy creates “the difficulty of
    maintaining any level of silence or interiority” and that resonated so
    deeply with me - I feel like over the past few years my thoughts have become
    more scattered and fragmented as I’ve replaced the quiet parts of my day
    where I might think and reflect with podcasts, Netflix, or TikTok and
    instead of sitting with the briefly uncomfortable transition to consuming
    ideas to engaging with my own, I often turn to the easy pleasure of
    manufactured content. I’m trying to unlearn this pattern and regain my
    interiority.

    She quotes some Italian philosopher on the idea that an alternative to
    repression of dissent is proliferation of useless chatter and this certainly
    rings true of the social media algorithms I’m on. Twitter was a significant
    part of my political radicalization in seeing some ideas that I had
    uncritically internalized challenged for the first time, in ways that made
    me read more and learn more and ask questions and change my beliefs. But all
    of the constructive work of building my politics has happened off the
    internet - it’s so much easier to make a pithy point in a small number of
    characters than it is to reckon with the complexity and nuance inherent in
    healing, building, growing, and maintaining.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also really liked her ideas of placefulness and bioregional awareness as a
    way to be deeply and locally present and aware. Ro got me a book on tree
    identification and I’ve been using the iNaturalist app she mentions in the
    book to identify spring flowers in DC and it’s been so meditative and joyful
    - I feel like I’m connecting the curiosity and attention I had as a kid. I
    understand more now what Robin Wall Kimmerer talked about in Braiding
    Sweetgrass when she remarked on how alone she would feel without her
    knowledge of the plants and ecology around her that gave her a sense of
    place and community - I’m slowly emerging from that ecological loneliness.
