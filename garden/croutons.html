  <h2>a very short essay on</h2>
  <h1>croutons and late capitalism</h1>

  <br />

  <p>
    It is the absolute silliest things that send me into a spiral about the
    world in which we live. Most recently croutons. Before that, helium and
    gyms.
  </p>

  <p>
    In learning to cook in the pandemic, figuring out what to do with stale
    bread lead to the discovery of how to make croutons at home. Croutons are
    wildly simple - slightly stale bread, oil, and spices; they're an ingenious
    way to turn something that might otherwise be waste into something useful
    again. And for some reason the fact that for all of my life I have been
    buying croutons hit me especially hard. It seems somewhat emblematic of my
    (our?) general disconnection from the roots of the practices, ideas, beings,
    and objects around me. Buying croutons from a store in which they are
    manufactured from scratch explicitly to meet the consumer need from
    something which originally prevented waste seems almost obnoxiously silly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Helium has a similar effect on my brain. Helium, as it turns out is mined
    from the earth and is a deeply finite resource - because its atomic radius
    is so small, it escapes its container and even escapes the atmosphere of the
    earth. The earth is
    <a
      href="https://www.mining.com/web/helium-is-soaring-on-red-hot-demand-shrinking-supply/"
    >
      running out of helium, one of the most abundant elements in the
      universe.</a
    >
    Liquid helium is essential to MRI machines. We have a limited amount of
    helium for all of the people and being that will ever live on this planet
    for all time and we're still putting it into baloons.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've always hated gyms, but there's something specific about the way in
    which gyms capture the dystopia of the present. People pay money to consume
    electricity on metal and plastic manufactured machines so they can prevent
    their bodies from atrophying because the rest of their lives are so
    sedentary. That feels very dark to me. If there were no other problems, I'd
    spend some time finding a way to create community pathways for the
    allocation of physical labor such that a couple strong young people who want
    to work out are connected with an elder neighbor who needs a piano moved up
    a few flights of stairs out of a basement or with a single parent who needs
    groceries from a store a few miles away. There must be a better system than
    gyms.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can't quite articulate yet why all of these ideas are related in my brain,
    except to say that they feel as though they are, and so far that's enough
    for me. Something about the dream of infinite resources and the
    disconnection from the constraints of biological and terrestrial reality
    feels emblematic.
