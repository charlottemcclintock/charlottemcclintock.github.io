  <h2>Akinyele Omowale Umoja</h2>
  <h1>We Will Shoot Back</h1>

  <br />
  <p>
    this book was such a compelling counterpoint to the histories of the Civil
    Rights Movement that glorify non-violence as a tactic. Umoja has so many
    useful ideas about movement building, the utility of national
    visibility/formal organization (and where that ends), and how southern Black
    communities coming together to keep each other safe had radical potential
    and impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Umoja tells incredibly detailed stories of the formation of Black
    paramilitary groups to protect protests, marches, key organizers, and to
    enforce boycotts. Even while SNCC and the NAACP had national commitments to
    non-violence, Mississippi organizers had to deal with local realities -
    armed white supremacist nightriders coming to murder and harm organizers and
    movement workers in the middle of the night. Umoja makes a compelling case
    that armed resistance was critical to the organizing of the Mississippi
    Black Freedom Struggle.
  </p>
  <p>
    this book has so many interesting stories - how Black haven communities used
    signals to communicate at night if an unknown car showed up in the
    neighborhood, a time when local county organizers used the fear of the Black
    Panthers to scare local white supremacists and stay safe, how bringing white
    students and northern Black organizers to Mississippi for Freedom Summer
    played out on the ground, how the Mississippi house passed a bill making
    organizing boycotts illegal and crippled the local NAACP with financial
    liabilities for losses to white businesses, and how a couple counties
    managed boycotts after the ban by avoiding connections to any formal
    organizations so no one was liable.
