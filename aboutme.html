          	<h2>Hi!</h2>
              <h1>I'm Charlotte.</h1>
              <p> My name is Charlotte McClintock and I’m a second year in the College of Arts & Sciences. I'm completing an Echols Interdisciplinary major in Decision Theory & Group Dynamics, an interdisciplinary study of human behavior through politics, economics, and behavioral science with statistics and data science classes to learn analytical methodologies. I’m fascinated by the general assumption of human rationality and the quirks and nuances of language and interaction that influence human choice. I’m hoping to write a thesis on critical mass in collective action, the threshold between success and failure in social movements, political revolutions, and market changes. I want to know what variables impact individual choice and collective action, and how to increase the probability of success for progressive causes. I hope to apply behavioral science and statistical analysis to policy and market decisions to measure and improve the impact of aid and social services.  This is the cutting edge of public interest work, using data to ensure all work and resources have clear, measurable, positive impact on those they hope to serve. Understanding individual and group behavior can minimize negative economic externalities in the market due to irrational consumer behavior, optimize the efficiency of government welfare programs, understand and predict transformational political movements, and inform policies to create social change. </p>
  						<p style=padding-bottom:20px> Outside of classes, I’m a lead researcher in the Public Interest Data Lab on a project to investigate alleged racial disparity and disproportionality in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System. Working with Professor Claibourn on this project has radically changed the course of my life, and inspired me to pursue projects data science for the social good as a career. I started the semester inexperienced in R and over the course of the semester I taught myself statistics and programming, driven by a desire to answer important questions with real impact on people’s lives. I have also been involved with Honor since my first semester at the University, first as a support officer, then as the chair of our Policies & Procedures subcommittee, and now newly elected as the Assessment and Data Management chair. I’m hoping to build out our data management infrastructure to better track demographic information for reported students. My vision, as chair, is to use this data to help Honor gain meaningful insights into its process, rather than relying on anecdotes. I spent much of this year competing for the Hult Prize, $1 million in seed funding for a scalable, sustainable social enterprise aimed at bringing 10 million people out of energy poverty by 2025. My team competed at the Boston Regional Final in March and pitched a venture to stop the energy theft by varying the impedance of transmitted electricity, partnering with electricity companies, and redistributing savings to connect new customers to the market. The process started as a moonshot. I pulled a team together and applied last December, not expecting to make it to the next round, but enjoying the application. We were lucky enough to be accepted as one of 3,000 teams selected from 100,000 applications to pitch at the regional finals. The brainstorming process has been incredibly challenging, and I have developed a deep respect for entrepreneurs who overcome the obstacles we’ve encountered. We’ve educated ourselves about capital heavy industries, the economics of utilities, and willingness to pay for the lowest income consumers. After hundreds of articles on energy, rural electrification, and development economics, we thought of and then let go of many ideas (from solar micro-grids, to electric bikes, and communication tech in the wake of a natural disaster), before finally setting on our current pitch. </p>
              <p style=padding-bottom:20px> I’ve discovered a deep love for photography. I’ve worked for the Cavalier Daily as a senior photographer and associate photo editor and for WUVA as a staff photographer primarily covering men’s basketball. I’m currently the manager of the Student Photo Initiative, a group of student photographers hired by ODOS to document student life, aiming to create an inclusive climate where each generation of students sees themselves reflected on the walls of the University. I’m always picking up my camera to take some shots of a friend on the lawn, document protests, or explore different parts of the university with a new CIO.</p>
