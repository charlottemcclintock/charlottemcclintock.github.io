	<h2>Digging into the data around tech solutions for providers serving survivors of domestic violence</h2>
    <h1>Evaluation of the Safe Shelter Collaborative</h1>
    <p>At <a class="intext" target="blank_" href= "https://www.caravanstudios.org">Caravan Studios</a>, I worked on the <a class="intext" target="blank_" href= "https://www.safesheltercollaborative.org">Safe Shelter Collaborative</a>, a platform 
     which enables domestic violence shelters to gather information about the location of shelter beds when they’re at capacity and would otherwise have to turn a survivor away.</p>
    <p><strong>Landscape Analysis:</strong> For the first few weeks of my summer, I worked on a 
    landscape analysis, identifying and evaluating possible regions for expansion of the 
    collaborative platform. In order for the platform to be effective, regions need multiple 
    providers within reasonable travel distance of each other and a coordinating body existing 
    in the region to make the collective decision to adopt the platform. I also worked to discover ongoing 
  conversations, areas of interest or focus, and already existing partnerships and coalitions in each region.</p>
    <p><strong>Evaluation & Data Analysis:</strong> For the majority of the summer, 
      I worked on an analysis of administrative data from the Safe Shelter Collaborative. 
      I explored agency participation, demographic trends, timeliness, and survivor placement outcomes to understand how they 
      might iterate on or expand their existing model. The platform allows a service provider to send a request to all 
      other participating agencies in the collaborative. The platform has a really excellent participation rate – most 
      requests are responded to within less than a minute, and most request have a ‘possible bed’ response within less 
      than three minutes. Regions vary significantly by the demographics of the survivors they serve, in gender, age, 
    and type of violence experienced. Recommendations were made for potential directions to move forward with the platform. </p>

      <p style=padding-bottom:20px> This summer taught me that technology can be a part of the 
        solution, but is generally not the whole solution. Technology needs to be accompanied 
        by changes in policy, in resources, in communities, and in systems in order to be an 
        effective tool to move the needle. We need technology and data science to accompany 
        community organizing efforts, policy advocacy, and the stories of affected communities. </p>
