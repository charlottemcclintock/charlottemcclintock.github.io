	<h2>The University of Virginia Honor System</h2>
    <h1>Bicentennial Analysis</h1>
    <p><a   target="blank_" href= "https://honor.virginia.edu">The Honor Committee at the University of Virginia</a> handles cases of lying, cheating, and stealing.
      The system is single sanction at hearing; if a student is found guilty of a significant offense, they are asked to leave the University.
      All cases are investigated, argued, and heard by students.</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2018, I approached the Committee and asked to start a working group to investigate
        demographic trends, evaluate policies, and address equity concerns. I was appointed as the first chair
        of Data & Assessment, and I lead a team to build out all of the data collection,
        management, analysis, and communication infrastructure. In deciding what data to collect, we had to
        think 5, 10, 15 years into the future and consider future possible concerns and questions in order to
        begin the data collection process now and weigh privacy concerns against evaluative benefit.
        We re-started collecting self-reported demographic information and have digitized 30 years of guilt verdicts and
        almost a hundred years aggregate totals in order to publish the first comprehensive analysis of
        Honor cases ever made public for <a   target="blank_" target="blank_" href= "https://report.honor.virginia.edu/bicentennial-data-analysis">the Bicentennial Report on Honor</a>. </p>

        <p> <a   target="blank_" target="blank_" href= "https://report.honor.virginia.edu/sites/report.honor/files/honor-bicentennial-analysis.pdf">Linked here</a>  is our analysis of case data, the result of hundreds hours
          of effort, mine and others, over six months to better understand demographics and case outcomes within
          the Honor System. We confirmed some suspected trends, and uncovered some we didn't expect. Thank you to
          Ory who has fought for the release of demographic data every step of the way and dug deep into the archives
          to tell lost stories. As Ory put so well, "The data within this report should not be viewed in dispassionate
          isolation and should be considered alongside the greater history of our constantly evolving Honor System,
          University, and society. Too often, the Honor System's available data has been guarded, a disservice to the
          University seeking to improve its most revered tradition. With the Bicentennial Report - of which this data analysis a significant part - we attempt to share the full story of the Honor System, with the spirit of transparency and honesty that defines the Community of Trust."</p>
