	<h2>The University of Virginia Honor System</h2>
    <h1>Bicentennial Analysis Project</h1>
    <p>The Honor Committee handles cases of lying, cheating, and stealing,
      and if a student is found guilty of a significant offense, they are asked to leave the University.
      All cases are investigated, argued, and heard by students. The Honor Committee has only sporadically
      collected demographic data, tracked case timelines, or looked at outcomes across dimensions of the
      report. In the past, the Honor System has faced substantial criticism based on a perception that minority students
      were over-reported to the system, but no one has ever actually investigated these concerns. </p>

      <p>Last spring, I approached the Committee and asked to start a working group to investigate
        demographic trends, evaluate policies, and address equity concerns. I am now the first chair
        of Assessment & Data Management, and I lead a team currently building out all of the data collection,
        management, analysis, and communication infrastructure. In deciding what data to collect, we are trying to
        think 5, 10, 15 years into the future and consider future possible concerns and questions in order to
        begin the data collection process now and weigh privacy concerns against evaluative benefit.
        We have re-started collecting self-reported demographic information and are currently digitizing 30 years of guilt verdicts and
        almost a hundred years aggregate totals in order to publish the first comprehensive analysis of
        Honor cases ever made public for the Bicentennial Report on Honor. </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:25px">I’m proud of this project because I know it will have important implications for the policies
          that affect students facing what is often one of the hardest times in their lives. The trends we
          are uncovering will have important ramifications for the future of our system. I’m also proud of
          this project because, at the end of the day, I am responsible for every decision that is made,
          from what to make public and how to communicate our results, to how to protect potentially identifiable
          student data, to how to deal with ambiguities in data and conduct the most robust analysis possible.</p>
