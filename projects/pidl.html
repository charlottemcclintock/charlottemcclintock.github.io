          	<h2>Racial disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System</h2>
              <h1>Public Interest Data Lab</h1>
              <p>I worked as lead researcher and project manager for the UVA Public Interest Data Lab on a two-year
                project partnering with the Charlottesville Department of Social Services to investigate claims
                of racial disparity and disproportionality in the Child Welfare System. I started with the Lab
                in the spring of 2018 as a student in the class, was promoted to lead researcher at the end of the term,
                and subsequently helped organize and run a continuation of the project with Professor Michele Claibourn,
                Director of Research & Data Services for the UVA Library. </p>
              <p>Children in the foster care system face an incredibly complex set of issues that are often hard
                to classify. For some children, being reunited with family is a positive outcome. For others,
                long term placement with a close family friend or family member might be better. More placements
                means less stability, but leaving a problematic placement could be better than staying. High numbers
                of face-to-face meetings with a caseworker could be an indicator of frequent movement & behavioral
                problems, or a caring and attentive caseworker. Academic literature and deep policy readings for
                context made it possible to investigate claims of disparity while acknowledging uncertainty and
                complexity inherent in the data.</p>
