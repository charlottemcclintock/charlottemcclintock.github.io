          	<h2>Racial disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System</h2>
              <h1>Public Interest Data Lab</h1>
              <p>I worked as lead researcher and project manager for the UVA Public Interest Data Lab on a two-year
                project partnering with the Charlottesville Department of Social Services to investigate claims
                of racial disparity and disproportionality in the Child Welfare System. I started with the Lab
                in the spring of 2018 as a student in the class, then worked as a lead researcher and project manager, 
                and helped teach the next iteration of the class in 2019.</p>
                <p>This was really the project where I learned how to do data-based research in the public interest, 
                  which kicked off a career interest in using data and research methods to help organizations, communities, 
                  and movements make informed decisions about their work. </p>

              <p>This project was challenging and messy and complicated, as the foster system very much is. 
                Children interacting with child welfare face an incredibly complex system that summarize and simplify for analysis. Quantifying and describing outcomes required careful and deliberate decision making to account for the wide variance in experiences. 
                For some children, being reunited with family is a positive outcome. For others,
                long term placement with a close family friend or family member might be safer for the immediate future. More placements
                means less stability, but leaving a problematic placement could be better than staying. </p>

                <p>This project also engaged with questions of racial disparity in Charlottesville, a city with a long history
                   of violent anti-Black racism. As is consistent with national trends in child welfare, 
                   Black and multiracial children were found to be disproportionately reported to the Child Welfare system, and are 
                   more likely to be screened in and enter foster care.
                </p>
