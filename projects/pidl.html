          	<h2>Racial disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System</h2>
              <h1>Public Interest Data Lab 2018</h1>
              <p>I currently work as a lead researcher and lab manager for the UVA Public Interest Data Lab on a
                project partnering with the Charlottesville Department of Social Services to investigate claims
                of racial disparity and disproportionality in the Child Welfare System. I started with the Lab
                in the spring of 2018 as a student in the class, became a lead researcher after the class ended,
                and am now helping to organize and run a continuation of the project with Professor Michele Claibourn,
                Director of Research & Data Services for the UVA Library. </p>
              <p>Children in the foster care system face an incredibly complex set of issues that are often hard
                to classify. For some children, being reunited with family is a positive outcome. For others,
                long term placement with a close family friend or family member might be better. More placements
                means less stability, but leaving a problematic placement could be better than staying. High numbers
                of face-to-face meetings with a caseworker could be an indicator of frequent movement & behavioral
                problems, or a caring and attentive caseworker. Academic literature and deep policy readings for
                context made it possible to investigate claims of disparity while acknowledging uncertainty and
                complexity inherent in the data.</p>
              <p style=padding-bottom:20px>The UVA Public Interest Data Lab is led by Michele Claibourn and jointly sponsored by the University of Virginia Library and the UVA Data Science Institute. The PIDL18 final report is currently confidential within the Department of Social Services, but will hopefully be made public soon.</p>
