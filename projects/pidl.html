          	<h2>Racial disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System</h2>
              <h1>Public Interest Data Lab 2018</h1>
              <p>During the spring of 2018, I worked in UVAâ€™s Public Interest Data Lab as Lead Researcher on a project to to investigate alleged racial disparity and disproportionality in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System. I worked under the absolutely incredible and incomparable Professor Michele Claibourn. I began the semester never having used R with little experience in analysis, deeply underqualified relative to the graduate students in the class, and finished out the project as the Lead Researcher contributing significantly to the analysis work. I found I deeply loved the work: being able to think critically through a complicated issue, applying empirical quantitative analysis to fields often dominated by narratives and anecdotes, and investigating an issue with real and immediate impact on human lives. </p>
              <p>Children in the foster care system face an incredibly complex set of issues that are often hard to classify. For some children, being reunited with family is a positive outcome. For others, long term placement with a close family friend or family member might be better. More placements means less stability, but leaving a problematic placement could be better than staying. High numbers of face-to-face meetings with a caseworker could be an indicator of frequent movement & behavioral problems, or a caring and attentive caseworker. Academic literature and deep policy readings for context made it possible to investigate claims of disparity while acknowledging uncertainty and complexity inherent in the data.</p>
              <p style=padding-bottom:20px>The UVA Public Interest Data Lab is led by Michele Claibourn and jointly sponsored by the University of Virginia Library and the UVA Data Science Institute. The PIDL18 final report is currently confidential within the Department of Social Services, but will hopefully be made public soon.</p>
