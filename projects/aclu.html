          	<h2>Providing evidence for criminal justice reform in Colorado</h2>
              <h1>Colorado Bail & Incarceration Project</h1>
              <p>In mid-December, I came across <a href="https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends"
                style="color: black; text-decoration: underline">a recently-released dataset</a> from the Vera Institute of
                Justice with county level incarceration data including both jail & prison data and demographics.
                I pitched it as a project to Data for Democracy, a global network of data practitioners volunteering
                on projects for social benefit. I also reached out to some attorneys I know in
                Colorado and got connected with the research team at the Colorado ACLU. </p>
                <p>I lead a project analyzing data on money bail for an ACLU report to inform policy and
                  persuade legislators to pass criminal justice reform policies in the upcoming state legsilative session.
                  We built a incredible team of 30 volunteers including working data scientists,
                  undergraduate, masters, and PhD students, and people interested in policy.
                  The project was also a pilot for the Data for Democracy Global Data Ethics Project code 
                  of ethics and ethical assessments framework.</p>

                  <p>The first challenge with the project was in managing a team of volunteers, 
                  all of whom had jobs and commitments outside of the project. Many of the folks who joined the project had only
                 technical backgrounds and were looking for ways to use their skills in the public interest but were not used to
                 immersing themselves in the social and political context of an issue in order to distinguish meaningful results from noise. 
                I quickly learned that most of the volunteers were looking for specific technical asks to execute on, rather than 
              hoping to join in the design of the research. Here we tried to identify tiers of engagement: some people wanted to be involved 
            at a high level in the planning, others wanted to pick up technical tasks or difficulties and fix them. Once that was sorted, managing the project became easier. </p>
            <p>The greatest challenge was the quality of the data which came from the open records requests. Each locality counted capacity differently, and some counties reported 
              non-integer numbers of incarcerated people, which we later discovered were rolling averages. Based on our experiences with the data, another volunteer and I 
              wrote <a href="d4d-hb1297-testimony.pdf" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline" target = "_blank">legislative testimony</a> 
              in support of <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1297"
              style="color: black; text-decoration: underline" target = "_blank">HB19-1297</a>, a bill to improve the quality of accountability data for jails in Colorado. Staff members from the ACLU read parts of
              our statement aloud to the state house judiciary committee and the bill was signed into law in May 2019.
            </p>
            <p>I also learned the power of personal relationships between people with technical skills and 
              people with access to data and questions. After the conclusion of the money bail work, I continued to get small questions and tasks from 
            my partner at the ACLU when they got data from open records requests that needed to be cleaned or quick questions that required a semi-complex analytical answer.</p>
