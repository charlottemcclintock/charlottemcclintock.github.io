          	<h2>Mapping early childhood resources</h2>
              <h1>Community Impact Lab</h1>
              <p>During the fall semester of 2018, I worked with a team of seven students to survey early childhood
                service providers to better understand what resources
                exist to support low-income children and families in Charlottesville and Albemarle.
                We see the project as building on the foundation of the Early Childhood Fiscal Map but
                taking the question from a new angle, hoping to understand how resources are distributed
                by type of service and by population served.

              <p>Our research led us to identify access and affordability of services, the importance of trust
              between clients and service providers, culturally relevant services, the intersectionality of
              need for low- income families, scarcity and capacity of resources, limited data and outcome
              measurement capacity, and lack of coordination between service providers as the major gaps
              in the Charlottesville- Albemarle early childhood landscape.</p>
              <p style = "padding-bottom:25px">In order to fill these gaps, we recommend exploring a peer navigator program,
                identifying capacity for Early Head Start, creating a central body for coordination,
                and expanding provider data capacity and system data integration. This report concludes
                with directions for future work, areas which we believe the ECFN could explore in future
                research. We recommend the ECFN consider pursuing further research by interviewing
                low-income families in order to understand their perspectives, evaluating policies and best
                practices from other communities and feasibility in Charlottesville and Albemarle County, and
                research- ing innovative financing and funding models in order to understand all possible
                channels for grantmaking (including pay for success, impact investing, and more).</p>
