    <h1>Data for Climate: Brightest Research</h1>

    <p>At <a class="intext" target="blank_" href= "https://brightest.io/">Brightest</a>, 
      I worked as a research and data science intern, focused on using open data to produce 
      meaningful, engaging, and accessible research for Brightest's userbase, an audience of activists, volunteers, 
      and progressive leaders in the United States.</a></p>
    
      <p><strong>The Missing Votes on Climate:</strong> For my first project, I wanted to better understand the best predictions about the impacts of climate change and compare 
        those to the actions currently being taken. 
        I searched for the best predictions about the effects of climate change and 
      sorted through the many ways to understand the potential impacts - temperatures, frequency of extreme weather events, 
    effect on biodiversity of ecosystems, agricultural production, human migration, and more. I chose to focus on a multidimensional 
    economic impact predictions from the Climate Impact Lab that include impacts on population, labor, energy, natural resources, crime, 
    and mortality and compare those to membership in the US Climate Alliance, a coalition of governors dedicated to meeting the goals of 
    the Paris Climate Agreement. Comparing predicted damages to commitments to action, we see that the states with the most severe predicted effects 
are also the states with the least action to address climate change. Comparisons with public opinion surveys from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication also showed that among states not in the US climate alliance, 
a majority of those surveyed believe in climate change and support climate action. After finishing the story, I pitched it to climate politics journalists and the story was picked up by Vice.

      <p style=padding-bottom:20px><strong>The (Untapped) Republican Climate Voters:</strong> I wanted my second 
        piece to build on the first: how might we understand the ways in which partisanship shapes climate opinion? 
        Are there any mediating factors or effects?  I dove into the literature and found some interesting studies. 
        Pearson, Bailey, Naiman, & Schuldt (2017) analyzed the GSS and found that lower income and non-white Republicans match (and sometimes exceed
        Democrats on climate concern. Upper income white Republicans were significant outliers - low climate concern that <i>decreased</i> between 2000 and 2010.
        I compared this to other partisanship crosstabs with climate opinion and found that moderate Republicans were also more similar to Democrats.
