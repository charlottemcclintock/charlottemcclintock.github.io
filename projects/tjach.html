          	<h2>Equity in service provision for our community's most vulnerable</h2>
              <h1>Race & Homelessness in Charlottesville</h1>
              <p>This effort came out of a coincidental meeting with the exective director 
                of our local homelessness coalition, the Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless (TJACH), where he expressed a desire to use their data 
              to understand racial equity in the provision of homelessness services but noted that they lacked the capacity. 
            I offered to help work on the project, and connected him to the Equity Atlas grant at UVA which supports community partners 
          efforts to use data to understand equity in the region. This project became the pilot project for the grant and I worked as the principal researcher.</p>
                <p>Over the course of eight months, I read the literature to understand how racial disparities manifested in other communities, cleaned, analyzed, 
                  and modeled the data, met with TJACH and revised the analysis, and wrote up a report of the results. 
                  My research was presented to the board and is currently under study by a community working group composed 
                  of service providers and folks with recent lived experience of 
                homelessness (who are compensated for their time and effort). Our working group will advise 
                TJACH on how services might be altered or reorganized to better serve all in our community. </p>
                <p>The report will be published here when it is made public.</p>
