          	<h2>Equity in service provision for our community's most vulnerable</h2>
              <h1>Race & Homelessness in Charlottesville</h1>
          
                <p>I worked with the Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless (TJACH) in Charlottesville to 
                  investigate racial disparities in the provision of local homelessness services. This collaboration came out of a happy coincidence meeting 
                  with the exective director of TJACH, where he expressed a desire to use their data to understand racial equity in the provision of homelessness 
                  services but noted that they lacked the technical capacity to undertake the research. I was able to connect him to 
                the PIs on a grant through the UVA library which had funding to support community efforts to build data capacity in 
              service of equity in the region. This became the pilot project on that grant and I worked as the principal researcher.</p>
                  <p>After completing a report on racial disparity across the system of service providers, I also continued the project 
                    as a graduate thesis (Assessing Vulnerability in Homeless Individuals & Families: An Application of Factor Analysis & Item Response Theory).
                    The VI-SPDAT (Vulnerability Index Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool) is widely used by 
                    homelessness service providers to assess vulnerability in homeless individuals and families and determine who 
                    to prioritize for housing. The analysis explored data from the VI-SPDAT as administered in Central Virginia to assess whether 
                    the tool appropriately assesses vulnerability among unhoused people using classical test theory, item response theory, 
                    and factor analysis. I found that current item groupings collapse valuable information and that re-scoring of 
                    the assessment is potentially appropriate and suggested different groupings of items for interpretable subtests to inform 
                    providers about aspects of client vulnerability.
                  </p>
                <p>The report and thesis will be published here when they are made public.</p>
