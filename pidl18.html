          	<h2>Racial disparity in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System</h2>
              <h1>Public Interest Data Lab 2018</h1>
              <p>I worked as a Lead Researcher in the Public Interest Data Lab on a project to investigate alleged racial disparity and disproportionality in the Charlottesville Child Welfare System. Working with Professor Claibourn on this project has radically changed the course of my life, and inspired me to pursue projects data science for the social good as a career. I started the semester inexperienced in R and over the course of the semester I taught myself statistics and programming, driven by a desire to answer important questions with real impact on peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
  						<p style=padding-bottom:20px>The UVA Public Interest Data Lab is led by Michele Claibourn and jointly sponsored by the University of Virginia Library and the UVA Data Science Institute. The Lab provides data science experience to University of Virginia students in service of the public interest.</p>
